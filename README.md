_Diagram of a Vaultron cluster with integrated storage (Raft) flavor_

## What?

**Vaultron** uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (**NOTE: version 0.15.0+ required**) to build a tiny cluster of highly-available [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) servers for development, evaluation, and issue reproduction on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

----

> **NOTE**: While every effort is made to document Vaultron here in this file, you should **always consult the [official Vault documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/)** and **[Learn resources](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/) for the latest and complete documentation on using Vault itself**.

----

## Why?

It's a reasonably useful Vault environment deployed on your macOS or Linux computer _in a about 1 minute_.

Some of the more popular uses of Vaultron are:

- Getting acquainted with Vault
- Evaluating specific Vault features
- Issue reproduction and troubleshooting
- Testing
- ‼️ **NOT PRODUCTION** ‼️

## How?

Terraform assembles individual pieces to form Vaultron from the official [Vault Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/vault/) and [Consul Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/consul/).

Consul is used for storage by default, but there is also an integrated storage formula for [Raft storage](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/raft) as well. Consult the [Advanced Examples](#Advanced-Examples) section for more details on using the Raft storage flavor.

### Prerequisites

> **NOTE**: **Vaultron only supports Terraform version 0.12.0 and beyond** and is incompatible with previous Terraform versions.

Install the following on your Docker host where you will form Vaultron.

- [Docker CE for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/#server) **or**
- [Docker Desktop for macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
  - Last tested with version 3.5.2
  - Last tested with Engine version: 20.10.7
- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)
  - [OSS consul binaries](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul)
  - Vaultron's Docker image uses the latest Consul OSS version by default; you should have the latest `consul` binary installed on your Docker host
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (version 0.13.0+ required)
  - Last tested with version 1.0.3
  - [OSS terraform binaries](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/)
  - **NOTE:** macOS Catalina users might need to refer to this [Terraform issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/23033#issuecomment-542302933)
- [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
  - [Install Vault](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install)
  - [OSS vault binaries](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/)
  - Vaultron's Docker image uses the latest Vault OSS version by default; you should have the latest `vault` binary installed on your Docker host

### Quickest Start (for macOS only)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can use the following example to form Vaultron and open the the Vault web UI in your browser on macOS.

You will most likely be prompted for your password to add the Vaultron CA certificate from `etc/tls/ca.pem` to the System Keychain. This will prevent TLS errors about an untrusted CA certificate when using the Consul and Vault web UIs.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron.git && \
  cd vaultron && \
  ./form && \
  . ./ion_darts && \
  ./blazing_sword && \
  sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustAsRoot \
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ./etc/tls/ca.pem && \
  open https://localhost:8200
```

----

> **NOTE**: The `form` script writes all stdout and stderr to the `log/vaultron_lifecycle.log` file and `blazing_sword` persists the unseal key and initial root token to a file in the `vault` directory named like `./flavors/"$TF_VAR_vault_flavor"/vault/vault_1500766014.tmp`. If this behavior makes you feel some type of way, you are welcome at any time to put Vaultron down and pick up another toy project instead.

----

### Quick Start (for Linux or macOS)

Vaultron uses the latest Consul and Vault OSS versions by default, so make sure that you have also installed the latest binaries for [Consul](https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/), [Vault](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/), and [Terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) locally, and that you have have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed as well.

After installing prerequisites, it takes just 3 steps to form Vaultron.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron.git`
2. `cd vaultron`
3. `./form`

When Vaultron is successfully formed, the output looks like this example.

```plaintext
[vaultron] [?] vaultron-network not present; creating ...
[vaultron] [+] Created attachable vaultron-network with subnet 10.10.42.0/24
[vaultron] [=] Form Vaultron! 
[vaultron] [i] Terraform has been successfully initialized! 
[vaultron] [i] Vault OSS version: 1.8.3 
[vaultron] [i] Vault flavor: Consul storage backed 
[vaultron] [i] Consul OSS version: 1.10.3 
[vaultron] [i] Terraform plan: 14 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. 
[vaultron] [i] Terraform apply complete! resources: 14 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed. 
[vaultron] [+] Vaultron formed in 20s.
```

Now you can visit the Vault web UI at [https://localhost:8200](https://localhost:8200) or visit the Consul web UI at [https://localhost:8500](https://localhost:8500).

There is also a message from the `form` script about setting important environment variables before executing the `vault` and `consul` CLI commands. You'll want these environment variables in your shell before trying to use the `consul` or `vault` CLI tools with Vaultron.

```shell
$ export CONSUL_CACERT="$(pwd)/red_lion/tls/ca.pem" \
       CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8500" \
       CONSUL_HTTP_SSL=true \
       CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="b4c0ffee-3b77-04af-36d6-738b697872e6" \
       VAULT_ADDR="https://127.0.0.1:8200" \
       VAULT_CA_CERT="$(pwd)/black_lion/tls/ca.pem"
```

You can instead source the `ion_darts` script to do all of this for you.

```shell
$ . ./ion_darts
```

which should output details like this example.

```plaintext
[vaultron] [+] Exported Vaultron environment variables:
[vaultron] [+] CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR: 127.0.0.1:8500
[vaultron] [+] VAULT_ADDR: https://127.0.0.1:8200
```

You are now ready to use Vault (and optionally Consul) with the respective web user interfaces, command line interfaces, or HTTP APIs.

Take a moment to verify that all of the Vaultron Docker containers are up:

```shell
$ docker ps -f name=vaultron --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
```

The output should resemble this example.

```plaintext
NAMES               STATUS
vaultron-vault0     Up 8 minutes (unhealthy)
vaultron-vault2     Up 8 minutes (unhealthy)
vaultron-vault1     Up 8 minutes (unhealthy)
vaultron-consulc2   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
vaultron-consulc1   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
vaultron-consulc0   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
vaultron-consuls0   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
vaultron-consuls2   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
vaultron-consuls1   Up 8 minutes (healthy)
```

Note that the Vault containers are `(unhealthy)` because they are not yet initialized and unsealed so that is actually expected at this time.

----

> **NOTE**: Before accessing the Vault or Consul web UIs you should add the Vaultron Certificate Authority (CA) certificate to your OS trust store. It is located under the root of this project at `etc/tls/ca.pem`. If you do not do this, your browser(s) will complain about the certificates presented by the Consul or Vault servers.

----

See the **TLS by Default** section for more details on handling the Vaultron Certificate Authority certificate.

### What's Next?

If you are new to Vault, then using Vaultron is a nice way to quickly get acquainted! Please begin by checking out the official [Vault Getting Started Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started).

#### Ten Things You Can do After Vaultron is Formed

1. Initialize Vault with [vault operator init](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init) using the default Shamir's Secret Sharing based seal.
2. Unseal Vault with [vault operator unseal](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/unseal) using 3 of the 5 unseal keys which were part of the initialization output.
3. Authenticate to Vault with [vault login](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/login) using the initial root that was part of the initialization output.
4. After initialization, unsealing, and login to your shiny new Vault, you can follow along with the [Your First Secret](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-first-secret?in=vault/getting-started) page
5. Use your local `consul` and `vault` binaries in CLI mode to interact with Vault server Docker containers.
6. Use the Vault web UI at [https://localhost:8200](https://localhost:8200).
7. Optionally, use the Consul web UI at [https://localhost:8500](https://localhost:8500) if you chose the Consul storage flavor.
8. Use the [Vault HTTP API](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/index.html).
9. Check out and experiment with the examples in the `examples` directories.
10. Clean up or reset: disassemble Vaultron and clean up Vault data with the `unform` script.

----

> **NOTE: The `unform` script attempts to remove most data generated while using Vaultron, including the existing Vault data, logs, and Terraform state — be careful when using it!**

----

The Docker private network is not removed during unform for reasons detailed elsewhere in this documentation.

The Terraform provider modules are also not removed to conserve resources and time involved in downloading them.

If you want to tear down the containers, but preserve data, logs, and state, you can use `terraform destroy` for that instead.

```shell
$ terraform destroy \
  -state=flavors/"$TF_VAR_vault_flavor"/tfstate/terraform.tfstate
```

Ensure that you have set a value for `TF_VAR_vault_flavor` or replace it with the path to the Vaultron flavor you are using.

If you are already familiar with Vault, and would like to save time by rapidly initializing, unsealing, and enabling a wide range of authentication and secret backends, execute the `blazing_sword` script to do all of this for you. The `blazing_sword` script uses the additional Terraform configuration located in `blazing_sword/main.tf`.

If you are familiar with Terraform, you can also use Terraform commands instead, but you'll need to manually specify the `CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR` and `VAULT_ADDR` environment variables before you can access either the Consul or Vault instances.

```shell
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR="127.0.0.1:8500" \
       CONSUL_HTTP_SSL=true \
       VAULT_ADDR="https://127.0.0.1:8200" \
       CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN="b4c0ffee-3b77-04af-36d6-738b697872e6"
```

### Advanced Examples

The following are more advanced examples of forming Vaultron using some of the different environment variables to define additional configuration.

#### OSS Integrated Storage Example

This example uses the integrated storage ("raft") backend, and a higher logging level than the default.

```shell
$ export TF_VAR_vault_flavor=raft \
    TF_VAR_vault_oss_instance_count=5 \
    TF_VAR_vault_server_log_level=info
```

What this does line by line:

- Enable the Raft storage flavor to use Raft storage instead of Consul and specify 5 open source edition Vault nodes.
- Set Vault log level to info instead of debug.

It is worth noting that when you `form` Vaultron, output will resemble this example.

```shell
$ ./form
[vaultron] [?] vaultron-network not present; creating ...
[vaultron] [+] Created attachable vaultron-network with subnet 10.10.42.0/24
[vaultron] [=] Form Vaultron!
[vaultron] [i] Terraform has been successfully initialized!
[vaultron] [i] Vault OSS version: 1.8.3
[vaultron] [i] Vault flavor: Integrated storage backed
[vaultron] [i] Terraform plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
[vaultron] [i] Terraform apply complete! resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
[vaultron] [+] Vaultron formed in 8s.
```

Note the **Vault flavor: Integrated storage backed** part.

When Vaultron forms this way, all Vault servers are started and ready, but not yet initialized, joined to form a cluster, or unsealed.

You either need to manually do this or use the `blazing_sword` script to do it (and a lot more) for you.

Once the cluster is ready, use [`vault operator raft list-peers`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/raft#list-peers) to learn about cluster health and leadership.

```shell
$ vault operator raft list-peers
```

**Example output:**

```plaintext
Node                Address              State       Voter
----                -------              -----       -----
vaultron-vault-0    10.10.42.200:8201    leader      true
vaultron-vault-1    10.10.42.201:8201    follower    true
vaultron-vault-2    10.10.42.202:8201    follower    true
vaultron-vault-3    10.10.42.203:8201    follower    true
vaultron-vault-4    10.10.42.204:8201    follower    true
```

#### Full Stack Example with Custom Binary & Telemetry Enabled

This example uses Consul storage, uses a custom Vault binary, and includes the statsd + Graphite + Grafana telemetry stack container to visualize Vault telemetry.

```shell
$ export TF_VAR_vault_flavor=consul \
    TF_VAR_vault_custom_instance_count=3 \
    TF_VAR_vaultron_telemetry_count=1 \
    TF_VAR_vault_server_log_level=trace \
    TF_VAR_vault_log_format=json \
    TF_VAR_consul_log_level=err
```

What this does line by line:

- Enable zero custom Consul instances.
  - custom Consul binary feature not yet available yet.
- Enable 3 custom binary based Vault instances which use the binary you place into the `custom` directory.
- Enable Yellow Lion, the statsd/Graphite/Grafana telemetry container.
- Set Vault log level to _trace_.
- Set Vault log formate to _json_.
- Set Consul log level to _err_ (Error).

Here are some slightly more serious notes and questions about what Vaultron is and how it can work for you.

Vaultron is only currently tested to function on Linux and macOS, but here is basically what you are getting by default if you successfully form one.

```

Vaultron using Consul storage consists of 3 Vault server containers, 3 Consul client containers, and 3 Consul server containers which run in a Docker private network called _vaultron-network_.

#### Vault Servers

- **vaultron-vault0**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.200
- **vaultron-vault1**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.201
- **vaultron-vault2**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.202

#### Consul Servers

- **vaultron-consuls0**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.100
- **vaultron-consuls1**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.101
- **vaultron-consuls2**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.102

#### Consul Clients

- **vaultron-consulc0**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.40
- **vaultron-consulc1**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.41
- **vaultron-consulc2**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.42

> NOTE: The `form` script creates the attachable Docker private network _vaultron-network_ with a subnet of 10.10.42.0/24 if it is not found to already be present. It is not removed by `unform` however, as other containers that are not part of Vaultron could be using it even when Vaultron's containers are stopped or removed.

#### Yellow Lion

An optional telemetry gathering and graphing stack (Yellow Lion) can be enabled at runtime via environment variable; see the **Telemetry Notes** section for more details. It uses the following IP addresses.

##### statsd

- **vaultron-vstatsd**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.219

##### Grafana

- **vaultron-vgrafana**
  - Docker private network IP: 10.10.42.220

Vault servers connect directly to the Consul clients, which in turn connect to the Consul server cluster. In this configuration, Vault is using Consul for both storage and high availability functionality.

This is unfortunately both simultaneously simpler and more complex, since in most production deployments, you want the Consul client agent on the Vault server, so this is more a "sidecar style" approach used out of ease of deployment at the cost of 3 extra containers and more complexity.

### Environment Variables

Vaultron uses environment variables to override some Terraform configuration items. You can use these to fine-tune the attributes of your own particular Vaultron configuration including, but not limited to:

- Vault version
- Storage flavor
  - Consul storage
    - Consul version
  - Integrated storage (Raft)
    - Raft storage path
- Whether to use OSS (default) or a custom Vault binary
- Vault operational log level

Here are the names and purposes of each:

#### TF_VAR_vault_license

Enterprise license to use

> NOTE: When using Vault Enterprise versions beyond 1.7.0 as a custom binary, you must set a valid license string as the value to `TF_VAR_vault_license` or Vaultron will not form.

- Default: none

#### TF_VAR_vault_version

Vault OSS version to use

> NOTE: Setting this has no effect when the value of `TF_VAR_vault_custom_instance_count` is greater than zero as the custom binary itself then determines the version used.

- Default: latest OSS version

#### TF_VAR_consul_version

Consul OSS version to use; currently Vaultron can use _only_ Consul OSS versions.

- Default: latest OSS version
- Acceptable values:
  - A valid Consul OSS version string, for example "1.9.2"

#### TF_VAR_docker_host

The [host](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/docker/index.html#host) value expressed as a protocol and address. (the equivalent of `DOCKER_HOST`)

- Default: `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`

Here is an example featuring a TCP host.

```plaintext
TF_VAR_docker_host=tcp://docker:2345
```

#### TF_VAR_vault_flavor (Vault v1.4.0+)

Vaultron can use different "flavors" for key Vault components.

Currently this is limited to switching between the integrated Raft storage or Consul storage backends; use this variable to specify the desired Vault storage backend type. Setting this will also set the correct number of Vault or Consul servers as appropriate.

- Default: consul
- Acceptable values:
  - `consul`
  - `raft`

#### TF_VAR_datacenter_name

Vault datacenter name

- Default: `arus`
- Acceptable values:
  - _alphanumeric string_

#### TF_VAR_vault_server_log_format (Vault v0.10.0+)

A valid Vault server log format

- Default: `standard`
- Acceptable values:
  - `json`
  - `standard`

#### TF_VAR_vault_server_log_level

Server operational log level

- Default: `debug`
- Acceptable values:
  - `trace`
  - `debug`
  - `info`
  - `warning`
  - `error`

#### TF_VAR_consul_log_level

A valid Consul log level

- Default: `debug`
- Acceptable values:
  - `trace`
  - `debug`
  - `info`
  - `warn`
  - `err`

#### TF_VAR_vault_path

Set `path` value for Consul storage stanza

- Default: `vault`
- Acceptable values:
  - _alphanumeric string_

#### TF_VAR_vault_raft_path (Vault v1.4.0+)

Set `path` value for Raft storage stanza

- Default: `/vault/data`
- Acceptable values:
  - _alphanumeric string_

#### TF_VAR_vault_cluster_name

Cluster name

- Default: `vaultron`
- Acceptable values:
  - _alphanumeric string_

#### TF_VAR_disable_clustering

Disable Consul HA clustering

- Default `false`
- Acceptable values:
  - `true`
  - `false`

#### TF_VAR_vault_oss_instance_count

Number of Vault OSS containers; you should not need to set this as it is set automatically when you choose a flavor with `TF_VAR_vault_flavor`.

- Default: `3`
- Acceptable values:
  - `0` when using a custom binary
  - `3` when using OSS and Consul storage backend
  - `5` when using OSS and Raft storage backend

#### TF_VAR_vault_custom_instance_count

Number of Vault custom containers; set this only when using a custom Linux/ADM64 `vault` binary placed in the `custom` directory.

- Default: `0`
- Acceptable values:
  - `0` when using OSS
  - `3` when using a custom binary and Consul storage backend
  - `5` when using a custom binary and Raft storage backend

#### TF_VAR_vault_custom_config_template

Specify an alternative configuration file template in `black_lion/templates/custom`

- Default: `vault_config_custom.hcl`
- Acceptable values:
  - _valid filename to HCL configuration file_

#### TF_VAR_use_consul_oss

This should not currently be changed as Vaultron only supports Consul OSS.

- Default: `1`
- Acceptable values:
  - `0`
  - `1`

#### TF_VAR_consul_recursor_1

DNS recursor 1

-Default: `1.1.1.1`

#### TF_VAR_consul_recursor_2

DNS recursor 2

- Default: `1.0.0.1`

#### TF_VAR_consul_acl_datacenter

Consul datacenter name

- Default: `arus`

#### TF_VAR_consul_data_dir

Consul data directory path

- Default: `/consul/data`

#### TF_VAR_consul_oss

`1` to use OSS Vault binaries from releases.hashicorp.com (currently only option)

- Default: `1`
- Acceptable values:
  - `1`

#### TF_VAR_consul_oss_instance_count

Number of Consul OSS containers

- Default: `3`
- Acceptable values:
  - `0`
  - `3`

### Published Ports

Each Vault instance is available to the local computer, but through Docker's published ports scheme only, so the API addresses of the Vault servers are:

- `https://localhost:8200`
- `https://localhost:8210`
- `https://localhost:8220`

The cluster port (for the Active instance only) is also forwarded to localhost at `https://localhost:8201`

### Changing Vault OSS and Consul OSS Versions

Vaultron runs the `:latest` official Vault Docker container image, but if you would prefer to run a different _OSS version_, you can export the `TF_VAR_vault_version` environment variable to override.

```shell
$ TF_VAR_vault_version=0.6.5 ./form
```

the output of which would then contain:

```plaintext
...
[vaultron] [i] Vault OSS version: 0.6.5
...
```

Similarly, to run a different version of the Consul container, set the `TF_VAR_consul_version` environment variable like this example.

```shell
$ TF_VAR_consul_version=0.7.5 ./form
```

After Vaultron forms, check the Consul version with `consul members`.

```plaintext
Node      Address          Status  Type    Build  Protocol  DC    Segment
consuls0  172.17.0.2:8301  alive   server  0.7.5  2         arus  <all>
consuls1  172.17.0.3:8301  alive   server  0.7.5  2         arus  <all>
consuls2  172.17.0.4:8301  alive   server  0.7.5  2         arus  <all>
vault0    172.17.0.5:8301  alive   client  0.7.5  2         arus  <default>
vault1    172.17.0.7:8301  alive   client  0.7.5  2         arus  <default>
vault2    172.17.0.6:8301  alive   client  0.7.5  2         arus  <default>
```

> **NOTE**: Be sure to always use the same versions of Consul and Vault binaries on your host system and the container image.

This changes the OSS version only; when using a custom Vault binary, the binary itself determines the version; see the **A note about custom Binaries** section for more details about using custom binaries.

Also note that if the OSS version of Consul or Vault you want to use does not have an official Docker image available, you'll encounter an error.

### Consul DNS

> **NOTE:** The following applies only to the Consul storage flavor.

When using the Consul storage flavor of Vaultron, the 3 Consul servers have DNS exposed to port 53 of their internal container addresses, and the Consul clients and Vault sever containers are configured to use those Consul servers for DNS lookups.

Additionally, Consul DNS API is also published from the first Consul server at `localhost:8600`, so you can query services and nodes using DNS like so:

```shell
$ dig -p 8600 @localhost consul.service.consul
```

which results in a response containing:

```plaintext
...
;; ANSWER SECTION:
consul.service.consul.  0 IN  A 10.10.42.102
consul.service.consul.  0 IN  A 10.10.42.100

### Best Practices and Security Configuration?

Given the intended use cases for this project, the working solution that results when Vaultron is formed is not in accordance with all production best practices. Specifically, Vaultron does not follow every best practice as highlighted in the [Production Hardening guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/operations/production-hardening), but **you should always strive to implement all best practice recommendations when operating Vault in production!**

Vaultron implement the following specific hardening practices from the guide:

- End-to-End TLS: All Vaultron components use end-to-end TLS by default.
- Single Tenancy: Vaultron uses the official Docker images for Consul and Vault, which are single-process images
- Disable Swap: Docker image does not configure a swap device
- Enable Auditing: A [File Audit Device](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit/file/) is configured by default if `blazing_sword` is used

#### Docker Container / OS

To better facilitate requirements like advanced troubleshooting and debugging, the following capabilities are added to the specified containers:

- Vault containers:
  - `IPC_LOCK`
  - `NET_ADMIN`
  - `SYS_ADMIN`
  - `SYS_PTRACE`
  - `SYSLOG`

- Consul containers:
  - `NET_ADMIN`
  - `SYS_ADMIN`
  - `SYS_PTRACE`
  - `SYSLOG`

#### Consul ACLs by Default

> Consul ACLs with a default allow policy are enabled for Vaultron v1.8.0 (using Vault v0.9.5/Consul v1.0.6) and beyond.

This was chosen to allow for ease of experimentation with ACL policies and the Vault Consul Secrets Engine. It is not the same as a production installation because it makes use of a shared **acl_master_token** for ease of configuration.

The value used for the shared ACL Master Token is:

- `b4c0ffee-3b77-04af-36d6-738b697872e6`

#### TLS by Default

Vaultron uses self-signed certificates for full mutual TLS communication between Vault servers and Consul agents. The certificates and keys were generated from Vault PKI Secrets Backends as described in [examples/tls/README.md](https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron/blob/master/examples/tls/README.md).

With this in mind, you need to ensure that the certificate authority is recognized by Vault and Consul; you can do this in a number of ways:

1. Import the `black_lion/tls/ca-pundle.pem` into your OS trust store
2. For Vault: use the `VAULT_CACERT` environment variable
3. For Vault: Pass `-ca-cert=` option with path to the `ca-pundle.pem` for all `vault` commands
4. For Consul: use the `CONSUL_CACERT` environment variable
5. For Consul: pass the `-ca-file=` option with path to the `ca-pundle.pem` for all `consul` commands

Here are some additional resources related to configuring ACLs and TLS:

- [Consul ACL System guide](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/acl.html)
- [Consul Encryption documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/encryption.html)
- [Vault TCP Listener documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/listener/tcp.html)

##### Vault PKI Secrets Engine Based TLS Configuration

All of the TLS certificates and keys used by Vaultron were created by Vaultron itself as documented in [examples/tls/README.md](https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron/blob/master/examples/tls/README.md).

There are also some additional certificate/key pairs already generated for use in configuring TLS for other containers often used with Vaultron, and specifically including the following:

- Grafana
- LDAP
- MySQL
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- Prometheus

You can even import the PKI Secrets Engines for the Root and Intermediate CAs and generate more roles, certificates, etc. as described in [examples/tls/README-IMPORT.md](https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron/blob/master/examples/tls/README-IMPORT.md).

There's also an `examples/tls/eybeams_tls` script that will do this import for you.

### Where's My Vault Data?

Your Vault data resides in different physical locations based on the chosen storage flavor.

#### Vault Data in Consul

Vault data stored in Consul's key/value store are written to the filesystem in the `flavors/consul/consul/consuls{0,1,2}/data` directories for each of the three Consul servers.

Here is a tree showing the directory structure for a Consul server at `flavors/consul/consul/consuls0`:

```plaintext
consul
└── consul
    └── consuls0
        ├── config
        │   └── extra_config.hcl
        └── data
            ├── checkpoint-signature
            ├── node-id
            ├── raft
            │   ├── peers.info
            │   ├── raft.db
            │   └── snapshots
            └── serf
                ├── local.snapshot
                └── remote.snapshot
```

#### Vault Data in Integrated Storage

If you use the Integrated Storage, your data is persisted to disk via the internal BoltDB implementation. In turn, these data can be found on the filesystem under in `flavors/raft/vault/vault{0,1,2}/data` directories for each of the 5 Vault servers.

For example, here is a tree view of the data for the _vault0_ server:

```plaintext
└── vault
    ├── vault0
    ├── audit_log
    │   └── audit.log
    ├── config
    │   ├── main.hcl
    │   └── storage.hcl
    └── data
        ├── raft
        │   ├── raft.db
        │   └── snapshots
        └── vault.db
```

### What About Logs?

The Docker containers are named as shown in the [Basic Architecture Overview](#basic-architecture-overview).

You can view operational logs for any container with `docker logs` like so:

```shell
$ docker logs vaultron-vault0
```

The Vault audit logs for any given _active server_ are available as:

- `./vault/vault0/audit_log/audit.log`
- `./vault/vault1/audit_log/audit.log`
- `./vault/vault2/audit_log/audit.log`

### Telemetry Notes

Vaultron includes a comprehensive telemetry gathering and graphing stack provided by the **Yellow Lion** module. This module is optional and enabled by an environment variable value.

It provides statsd, Graphite, and Grafana from the addition of two official Grafana container images.

You can enable Yellow Lion by setting the value of the *TF_VAR_vaultron_telemetry_count* environment variable to **1**:

```shell
$ export TF_VAR_vaultron_telemetry_count=1
```

prior to the execution of `form`.

You can then access Grafana at: `https://127.0.0.1:3000/` After Vaultron is formed and login with the following credentials:

- username: `admin`
- password: `vaultron`

Once signed in, you can access the example **Vault** dashboard; you'll need to initialize, unseal, and do some work with Vault before metrics begin to appear. Adjusting the time filtering in the Grafana UI to a more recent span can also help.

See the [Visualizing Vault Telemetry](https://github.com/ram-parameswaran/vaultron/blob/master/examples/telemetry/README.md) documentation for more details on this setup.

### A Note About Custom Binaries

Vaultron installs the official open source Vault binaries through the official Docker container images, but if you'd prefer to use recent source builds or some other Vault binary, just drop `vault` into `custom/` and set these environment variables prior to forming Vaultron:

```shell
$ export TF_VAR_vault_oss_instance_count=0 \
       TF_VAR_vault_custom_instance_count=3 \
./form
```

----

> **NOTE**: When using custom binaries in this way the binary must be for Linux/AMD64 as that is the platform for the containers, also Vaultron ignores the value of `TF_VAR_vault_version` since the binary itself determines the version so keep that in mind as well.
>
> All OSS containers do execute _vault_ as the _vault_ user as designed, but one major disadvantage of the current custom binary scheme is that it chooses a simplest approach to introducing the `vault` binary by changing the path from which `vault` is executed. This breaks the preferred dedicated user model such that the process is executed by the _root_ user instead of the _vault_ user, so please keep this in mind when using custom binaries.

----

## Basic Troubleshooting Questions

### I can access the Consul UI but it states that there are no services to show

Access **Settings** in the navigation and ensure that the ACL master token is present in the text field, then click **Save** or **Close** depending on Consul version.

### Vaultron Does Not Form — Halp!

Instead of seeing the glorious interlocks activated, dyna-therms connected, infra-cells up, and mega-thrusters going, Vaultron fails to form and I get:

```plaintext
[e] Vaultron cannot form! Check terraform apply output.
```

or this:

```plaintext
[e] Vaultron cannot form! Check terraform plan output.
```

This means that Vaultron had problems during the `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` steps. You can run those commands manually and inspect their output to troubleshoot the issue.

Other red and equally frightening errors could occur, and these are usually accompanied by an explanation from Terraform regarding the nature of the problem.

### Error: Unable to upload volume content

Errors of this form (which can reference other directory names) typically indicate a problem with the underlying Docker storage.

```plaintext
Error: Unable to upload volume content: Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/home/user/src/vaultron/flavors/raft/vault/vault3/data': mkdir /home/user/src/vaultron/flavors/raft/vault/vault3: file exists
```

You can work around this issue by either restarting Docker Desktop, or by using the **Preferences** > **Troubleshoot** > **Clean / Purge data** from within the Docker Desktop UI or otherwise reset the Docker storage.

### Unknown token: 208:30 IDENT var.grafana_version

If you encounter an error forming Vaultron like the following:

```plaintext
Error: Error parsing <path>/vaultron.tf: At 208:30: Unknown token: 208:30 IDENT var.grafana_version
```

where `<path>` is your Vaultron project path, then you are likely attempting to form Vaultron on a Terraform version < v0.12.0; note that the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites) section mentions the requirement of Terraform v0.12.0+.

You can confirm your current version with `terraform version` and proceed accordingly.

### Vault is Orange/Failing in the Consul Web UI

Vault is expected to appear as failing in the Consul UI if you have not yet unsealed it.

Unsealing Vault should solve that for you!

### Vault Containers with Custom Binary are Exiting

My Vault containers are exiting and the `docker logs vaultron-vault0` output resembles this:

```plaintext
Using eth0 for VAULT_REDIRECT_ADDR: http://172.17.0.10:8200
Using eth0 for VAULT_CLUSTER_ADDR: https://172.17.0.10:8201
/vault/custom/vault: line 3: syntax error: unexpected end of file (expecting “)”)
```

This is a symptom of using the incorrect custom binary platform; the containers Vaultron uses are Linux AMD64 based, so you must place a Linux/AMD64 version of the `vault` binary into the `custom` directory to successfully use custom binaries.

### NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID or Other TLS Errors When it Was Working?!

If you encounter TLS related errors when Vaultron previously worked for you, there's a possibility that the TLS certificates were updated since you last installed the CA certificate for Vaultron.

Try removing the previous CA certificate (which will appear as "node.arus.consul") and reinstalling the current CA certificate from `etc/tls/ca.pem`.

### Vaultron cannot form; there are Vaultron containers currently stopped or running

Vaultron does not allow `form` to be used when there are already existing Vaultron Docker containers stopped or running. You can encounter an error like the following:

```plaintext
[vaultron] [!] Vaultron cannot form; there are Vaultron containers currently stopped or running
[vaultron] [i] Please unform existing Vaultron or use docker stop and docker rm to manually
[vaultron] [i] clean up the vaultron- containers shown here:

NAMES               STATUS
vaultron-vault2     Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-vault1     Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-vault0     Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consulc0   Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consulc1   Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consulc2   Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consuls1   Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consuls0   Up About a minute (healthy)
vaultron-consuls2   Up About a minute (healthy)
```

If this occurs, be sure that you are not trying to `form` Vaultron while it is already up and running (hint check the output of `docker ps -a | grep vaultron`).

If `unform` fails to clean up the containers, you will need to use `docker stop` and `docker rm` to stop and remove the containers:

```shell
$ for i in {0..2}; do docker stop "vaultron-vault${i}" \
  && docker rm "vaultron-vault${i}"; \
  done
vaultron-vault0
vaultron-vault0
vaultron-vault1
vaultron-vault1
vaultron-vault2
vaultron-vault2
```

```shell
$ for i in {0..2}; do docker stop "vaultron-consuls${i}" \
  && docker rm "vaultron-consuls${i}"; \
  done
vaultron-consuls0
vaultron-consuls0
vaultron-consuls1
vaultron-consuls1
vaultron-consuls2
vaultron-consuls2
```

### Something, Something — Storage HA Problem!

High Availability mode has been shown to work as expected, however because of the current published ports method for exposing the Vault servers, you must be sure to point your client to the correct Vault server with `VAULT_ADDR` once that server becomes the new active server.

Here is simple method to watch HA mode in action using two terminal sessions:

```plaintext
Terminal 1                              Terminal 2
+-----------------------------------+   +------------------------------------+
| VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8210\|   | docker stop vaultron-vault0        |
| watch -n 1 vault status           |   |                                    |
|                                   |   |                                    |
| ...                               |   |                                    |
| HA Enabled             true       |   |                                    |
| HA Cluster             https://...|   |                                    |
| HA Mode                standby    |   |                                    |
| ...                               |   |                                    |
|                                   |   |                                    |
|                                   |   |                                    |
+-----------------------------------+   +------------------------------------+
```

1. In Terminal 1, set `VAULT_ADDR` to one of the two Vault standby containers and use `watch` to keep an eye on the output of `vault status` while noting the values of `Mode:` and `Leader:`
2. In Terminal 2, stop the *active* Vault instance with `docker stop`
3. You should notice that the value of `Leader:` changes instantly and if the second standby Vault is elected the new active, the value of `Mode:` will also reflect that instantly as well

### Unsupported Versions?

If you try exporting `TF_VAR_consul_version` or `TF_VAR_vault_version` to a specific version, but get this error when you attempt to form Vaultron:

```plaintext
[e] Sorry, Vaultron does not support Consul version: 0.6.4
```

or:

```plaintext
[e] Sorry, Vaultron does not support Vault version: 0.6.0
```

You are specifying either a non-existent version (maybe a typo?) or you are specifying a version for which no Docker images exists. This second case is not a problem with Vaultron, there are some versions of Consul and Vault which were released as binaries, but not available as Docker images.

### syntax error: unexpected end of file (expecting ")")

If Vaultron forms, but the Vault containers all exit and you observe this error when inspecting the docker logs for the Vault containers:

```plaintext
/vault/custom/vault: line 3: syntax error: unexpected end of file (expecting ")")
```

This is likely because you have placed a macOS version of the `vault` binary in the `custom` directory instead of a Linux binary.

This can be confirmed with the `file` command:

```shell
$ file custom/vault
custom/vault: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
```

If this is the case, please replace the `vault` binary with the Linux AMD64 version.

### server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client

If you encounter an error like this when attempting to run `blazing_sword`:

```plaintext
Error initializing: Put https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/init: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client
[vaultron] [!] Cannot initialize Vault!
[vaultron] [!]
```

Ensure that you do not have another `vault` process which was already listening at 127.0.0.1:8220 when you formed Vaultron.

Often this is caused by a `-dev` mode instance of Vault running on the Docker host.

### Error: Unable to read Docker image into resource: Unable to pull image

If you encounter an error like the following:

```plaintext
Error: Unable to read Docker image into resource: Unable to pull image vault:1.2.4: error pulling image vault:1.2.4: Error response from daemon: manifest for vault:1.2.4 not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown
```

Then it is likely that the docker image for the version of Vault (in this example 1.2.4) is not yet published to DockerHub. You'll have to try again when the image becomes available.

### [: : integer expression expected

If you are executing the `form` script and encounter an error containing `[: : integer expression expected` followed by a long series of errors, please examine your environment variable values:

```shell
$ printenv | grep TF_VAR
TF_VAR_vault_flavor=raft
TF_VAR_vault_custom_instance_count=5
TF_VAR_vault_oss_instance_count=0
TF_VAR_vault_server_log_level=info
```

Ensure that there are no empty values (use `0`) following the `=` for any variable.

### Some Other Undefined Problem!

Have you tried turning it off an on again?

No, seriously — given the nature of this project, sometimes if you cannot resolve the issue root cause, then the easiest way out of a jam could be the _old nuke it from orbit and start_ over approach.

In this case, when you're stumped and don't mind starting anew, then just `unform` and `form` Vaultron again:

```shell
$ ./unform
[vaultron] [=] Unform Vaultron ...
[vaultron] [*] Vaultron unformed!
```

```shell
$ ./form
[vaultron] [=] Form Vaultron!
...
```

Other things that can help include:

- Unset all related Vaultron `TF_VAR_*` environment variables
- Close terminal session/start with a fresh terminal session
- Use the latest release version from GitHub

Note that the GitHub Master branch strives to remain relatively stable, but a release is usually preferred.
